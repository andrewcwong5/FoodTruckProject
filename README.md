## Food Truck Rating Project

### Week 2 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
This project creates a food truck object class. Then the FoodTruckApp that has
the main method creates an array to store the food trucks that are reviewed.
Step 1. An Option Menu will appear when the app is run.
Step 2. Choose one of the numbered option, it makes sense to choose option 1 in order
to start inputing data for food trucks. User will be asked for 3 fields to enter info for:
name, foodtype, and rating. User can add up to 5 food trucks, but if they don't want to
add that many; the user can type quit when asked for next foodtruck name to exit to main menu.
Step 3. Option 2 will print out all the foodtrucks added so far.
Step 4.Option 3 will display the average rating of all the foodtrucks.
Step 5. Will quit the program.
### Technologies/Topics Applied
Used what we learned about "Objects" to create a food truck object class.
Then we created fields within the object like food truck name, Id, food type, and rating.
Established setters and getter methods to change and display the values stored in fields.
Used "Arrays" to store multiple objects.
Theres also a good amount of for loops to iterate the array efficiently with some if statements
placed in them to prevent bugs like improper user input.
There's a switch statement to display the menu and that's within the main do-while loop to cut down on
redundant lines of code to display the entire menu multiple times.

### Lessons Learned
I learned how to call methods from non static objects.
I also learned how to set values and get values for fields within a object class.
